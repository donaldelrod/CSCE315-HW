In order to run our program on putty to its full extent, if using putty on the compute servers, you first need to enable blinking on putty's settings. Next when in your main directory, type: 

'tic xterm-color-blink.txt' followed by 'export TERM=xterm-color-blink' followed by 'source ~/.bashrc' to enable blinking. Next type 'make' to compile the file, and './main to run the file'.
